# Traffic-Light
TIVA-C embedded system for a traffic light, utilizing GPIO, interrupts, Timers, and UART for logging.
// I created the code of the timers, GPIO, UART, main,interrupts

Each of the two roads has 3 car lights (green,yellow,red), and 2 pedestrian lights (red,green).

the timers tick and nearing the end of the green light, the yellow lights up, then the red.
A small slack time between switching the red lights to green for the intersection for safety.

A button for each pedestrain intersection can be pressed for them to pass safely by switching to red car lights
